VOiCe signals acquired in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (VOC-ALS)
******************************************************************
VOC-ALS is an available database of VOiCe signals acquired in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and healthy subjects consecutively recruited during routine clinic visits at the ALS Centre of the Federico II University Hospital of Naples in Italy. 

This database includes Italian 1224 voice signals recorded from 153 participants: 102 ALS patients (65 males and 37 females) with different severity of dysarthria and 51 healthy subjects (32 males and 19 females).

DATA DESCRIPTION
*************************
The voices of the participating subjects were recorded with Vox4Health, an m-health system that makes use of the microphone of a mobile device to obtain the voice signal in real time. As for the hardware, a Samsung Galaxy S8+ SM-G955F, running  Android 9.0 as the operating system, was used. To record the voices, the mobile device was kept around 20 centimetres away from the patients' mouths; the angle between the mobile and the mouth was around 45 degrees.

For each subject, this database contains:
- recording vocalizations of each vowel (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/) for a minimum of 5 seconds each, ensuring a continuous loudness; this gives origin to five audio files; and
- recordings of the subjectâ€™s voice during reiteration in a single breath of each of the three syllables /pa/, /ta/, and /ka/ in the fastest possible way; this results in three audio files.

All the recordings were gathered at a sampling frequency of 8000 Hz and a 16-bit resolution. They took place under conditions of quietness (< 30 dB of background noise), dryness (humidity rate of about 35-40%), and absence of emotional and physiological stress.

In addition, demographic information and detailed clinical profiles are provided for each participant to provide further information on how particular disease characteristics are related to basic derived speech metrics.

ACCESS TO DATA
********************************
You must have a Synapse account in order to access restricted data in Synapse. When creating a Synapse account you agree to the Synapse Terms and Conditions of use. 

To access the data, select the "Files" tab and select the desired data folder.
Voice recordings are, in fact, organised in 8 folders, each containing the different voice tasks requested of the participants:
-phonationA: contains vocalization of vowel /a/;
-phonationE: contains vocalization of vowel /e/;
-phonationI: contains vocalization of vowel /i/;
-phonationO: contains vocalization of vowel /o/;
-phonationU: contains vocalization of vowel /u/;
-rhythmKA: contains repetition of the syllable /ka/;
-rhythmPA: contains repetition of the syllable /pa/; and
-rhythmTA: contains repetition of the syllable /ta/.

Additionally, a file .xlsx containing the information about the participants to the study is available to download.
